# ardalesTur_finalProject_codeSpace
I have been working the last season of the course in this project that a company commissioned me, they needed a website to sell their product to the world. I decided to turn the web over in the front-end aspect because after all they didn't need much functionality and most of the parts were commissioned. I worked conscientiously on learning to use parallax and react pose and it has been a productive and quite satisfactory learning. The images are 100% provided by the company ArdalesTur and I modified them in photoshop to create the parallax in layers.
